## RayGUI_cs

RayGUI_cs is a **complementary** GUI library for the C# [wrapper](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs) of the graphic library [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

## Installation

To use the library, you need to grab one of the NuGet package releases from the officiel [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/) by simply running the following command : 

```
dotnet add package RayGUI-cs
```
or by adding it manually through the Visual Studio 2022 packet manager.

You can now use the library's functions and classes inside of your Raylib project and enjoy a great GUI.
